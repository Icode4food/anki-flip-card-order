# Overview
When memorizing language vocabulary, you generally want to see the new word in the language you are learning before you see the known language word. Sometimes when you add words to Anki they cards don't automatically show in your preferred order. 

This addon solves this problem by adding a button on the bottom of the review screen that will switch to the other card. This addon currently only works with note types that have only two cards defined.
